# Config

## Api Keys

1. This app requires a rawg.io API key. You can get it from the rawg.io website.
2. Once you have the API key, place it in the docker-compose.yml file in place of `<api key>` to give the app access to the RAWG api.

# Running the app

You can run the app using the `docker-compose up --build` command in the root folder of the app.
